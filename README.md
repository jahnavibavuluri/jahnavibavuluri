## 👋  Hello! 

My name is Jahnavi Bavuluri, and I'm currently studying at Rutgers Honors College majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Economics. I am currently working part time as a Virtual CS tutor for topics ranging from beginner level programming to more advanced concepts such as Machine Learning and Web/iOS App Development. I am excited to be joining Expedia Group this summer as a Software Development Engineer Intern. 

In the past, I have worked on a number of projects ranging from Full Stack Engineering, Machine Learning, and Backend Development. My most recent project was an iOS Mobile Application, [Shanti - Mental Health App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shanti-mental-health-app/id1529500894), built primarily to help combat the rapid increase in mental health issues as a result of COVID-19. This application was built using a Python-Flask backend, SQLite database, and Swift frontend. The app is available for free [download](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shanti-mental-health-app/id1529500894) on the App Store. 

The summer prior to that, I worked as a Machine Learning Lead at a [Rutgers Materials Science Labratory](https://mse.rutgers.edu/) where ML algorithms were created to differentiate between different DNA bases. I used various Python tools and libraries including Pandas and Sklearn. Statistical analyses and algorithms were also used to create a ML algorithm with over 80% success. 

My strengths are Java, Python, and Swift. I have also worked with various other languages, frameworks, and tools. I am a quick learner, a driven programmer, creative, and always looking for new projects and skills to learn!
