## 👋  Hello! 

My name is Jahnavi Bavuluri, and I am a graduate from Rutgers Honors College majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Economics. This past summer, I interned as a Software Engineer Intern at Salesforce. I worked on automating a data pipeline for a company-wide metric using Apache Airflow and Astronomer to manage the ETL jobs in Kubernetes. The pipeline automation set a robust long-term solution in place, eliminated any manual interaction from the previous data flow, and improved overall data reliability.


The summer prior to that, I interned as a Software Development Engineer Intern at Expedia Group. I worked on a Machine Learning model to predict estimated wait time (EWT) for customer calls and experimented with various models ranging from Linear Regression to Neural Networks. My final ML model was 20% more consistent and 13% more accurate than the other contending models. Furthermore, I also constructed a Python service featuring my model and deployed it into production with some traffic being routed to my service for real time EWT predictions. 

In the past, I have worked on a number of projects ranging from Full Stack Engineering, Machine Learning, and Backend Development. In the summer of 2020, I created an iOS Mobile Application, [Shanti - Mental Health App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shanti-mental-health-app/id1529500894), built primarily to help combat the rapid increase in mental health issues as a result of COVID-19. This application was built using a Python-Flask backend, SQLite database, and Swift frontend. The app is available for free [download](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shanti-mental-health-app/id1529500894) on the App Store. 

The summer prior to that, I worked as a Machine Learning Lead at a [Rutgers Materials Science Labratory](https://mse.rutgers.edu/) where ML algorithms were created to differentiate between different DNA bases. I used various Python tools and libraries including Pandas and Sklearn. Statistical analyses and algorithms were also used to create a ML algorithm with over 80% success. 

My strengths are Java, Python, and Swift. I have also worked with various other languages, frameworks, and tools. I am a quick learner, a driven programmer, creative, and always looking for new projects and skills to learn!
